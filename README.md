Pokémon Card e
=========

This is a disassembly of the e-Reader cards released for Pokémon Emerald. Currently, it includes the French release of the Pokémon Battle e series, the Eon Ticket.

RGBDS is needed to compile the Z80 binary for each card. To build a working e-Reader card, you will need to compress the binary and add the card metadata using nedcmake from the nedclib package, which is unfortunately Windows-only.
